          <p>To honor the extraordinary life of Stoyan Christowe, and to uphold and keep alive his literary work, in 2010 the Macedonian Arts Council established The <span style={{color:"#880000"}}><i>STOYAN CHRISTOWE SCHOLARSHIP FUND</i></span>.  The first three graduates granted a scholarship earned their BA degrees in classical studies and literature, in  May 2014.  The total contribution by the Arts Council was $12,000. To ensure ongoing, permanent support of students in need of financial aid, the Scholarship will morph into an Endowment Fund.</p>
    <p>The Macedonian Arts Council is in discussions with several institutions that played a major role in the shaping of  Stoyan Christowe’s  writing and political careers,  for the purpose of establishing a permanent endowment fund through which  each year one  economically disadvantaged  high school graduate in Macedonia will be selected to attend college at the <a href="http://www.ukim.edu.mk/" target="new"><b>Sts. Cyril and Methodius University</b></a> in the capitol, Skopje.  The field of studies will be limited to the two subjects that Stoyan Christowe was passionate about and excelled in:  Literature and/or political science. The endowment fund will support four students,  each in a different  academic year  and it will be managed, in perpetuity, by the US based education institution.</p>
